# Repo conventions

You are building one reviewed mini-app in this repository. This file is the local,
checked-in half of your instructions; your system prompt is the other half. Where
they overlap, they agree. Where this file is more specific, follow it.

## What this repo is

A **node-free static frontend plus PocketBase hooks**. No build step, no package
manager, no bundler, no framework. The browser loads the files as written, and
PocketBase 0.39 runs `pb_hooks/` in an embedded Goja VM.

```
index.html            the app (add more .html pages beside it as needed)
pb-auth.js            the identity seam — read it before you write any data code
design-system/        vendored, read-only: tokens, components, behaviours
pb_hooks/main.pb.js   server-side hooks (Goja, not Node)
pb_hooks/identity.pb.js       identity layer, read-only
pb_migrations/1756540000_identity.js   identity schema, read-only
pb_migrations/        committed schema; add yours alongside the identity one
spec.json             YOU create this — the agreed governance spec
.github/workflows/    CI, read-only
```

## Identity

People sign in once, at `id.solhann.net`. **Whether someone may use this app at all is
not this app's decision** — the identity provider refuses an authorization code to
anyone who has not been granted access to this app, so a person without a grant never
reaches your code at all. You do not write a login screen, a permission check for
"is this person allowed in", or anything that decides who gets an account.

What you DO get:

```js
PBAuth.signIn()      // start the login
PBAuth.user()        // the signed-in record, or null
PBAuth.isSignedIn()
PBAuth.isAdmin()     // an admin OF THIS APP — server-set, safe to branch on
PBAuth.onChange(fn)  // re-render when sign-in state changes
PBAuth.getClient()   // the PocketBase client, authenticated
```

Rules on your collections key on `@request.auth.id`, and admin-only operations key on
`@request.auth.role = "admin"`. Never key a rule on anything the browser chooses.

**Sessions are short — thirty minutes — and there is no silent renewal.** That is
deliberate: it is what makes revoking someone's access take effect while they are
sitting there, rather than five days later. `PBAuth.onChange(fn)` fires with `null` the
moment a session lapses, so render a sign-in control at that point and let the person
click it — with the identity provider's cookie still live, the popup completes and
closes on its own. Do **not** call `PBAuth.signIn()` from a timer or straight out of
`onChange`: a popup opened without a click is blocked by the browser, and the person is
left on a page that quietly stopped working. Do not reach past `PBAuth` to
`authRefresh()` either; the server refuses it.

Three files carry this and **CI fails if you edit or delete any of them**:
`pb-auth.js`, `pb_hooks/identity.pb.js`, `pb_migrations/1756540000_identity.js`. They
are not scaffolding to clean up. `users.role` is written server-side from the identity
provider on every login; nothing a request contains can set it.

## Placeholders

The template ships with `{{SLUG}}`, `{{TITLE}}` and `{{DESCRIPTION}}`
placeholders (generating a repo from a template does not substitute them). Replace
every one before you open the pull request. CI fails if any survive.

## The design system is law

`design-system/` is a vendored snapshot of Greenlight's. Link it, use it, do not
edit it — CI fails on any diff under that directory.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bricolage+Grotesque:opsz,wght@12..96,500;12..96,600;12..96,700;12..96,800&family=Hanken+Grotesk:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="design-system/tokens.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="design-system/components.css">
<script src="design-system/components.js" defer></script>
```

Use the tokens (`var(--space-4)`, `var(--text-base)`, `var(--surface)`, …) rather
than hard-coded values, and the components (`.panel`, `.card`, `.btn`, `.chip`,
`.dtable`, `.field`, `.input`, `.badge`, `.empty`, `.topbar`) rather than new ones.
Page-specific CSS goes in a `<style>` block on that page. Open
`design-system/styleguide.html` to see everything rendered.

House rules: British English, sentence case, and never `·` middot separators — use
commas or dashes.

## Hooks

Handlers run in **isolated pooled VMs**. Nothing at the top level of a `.pb.js`
file is visible inside a handler — not functions, and not `const` either. Shared
code goes in `pb_hooks/lib/*.js` and is pulled in *inside* each handler:

```js
routerAdd("GET", "/api/thing", (e) => {
  const helper = require(__hooks + "/lib/helper.js");
  return e.json(200, helper.list(e.app));
});
```

Forbidden, and checked by CI:

- any `$os.*` call except `$os.getenv`
- `$http.send` unless `spec.json` declares an outbound scope — a `scopes` entry of
  the form `net:<host>`, e.g. `"net:api.postcodes.io"`
- `cronAdd` unless `spec.json` has `"runtime_shape": "scheduler"`
- `require()` of anything that is not under `__hooks`
- `package.json`, `node_modules`, or committed binaries

The check does not strip comments before it looks, so a commented-out `$os.cmd`
example still fails. Delete it rather than commenting it out.

## Schema

If the app needs collections, they are **committed migrations** in `pb_migrations/`,
the same files a local PocketBase writes under automigrate. Never write code that
assumes someone will create a collection by hand.

## Data

Ship with invented, obviously-fake data unless the spec says otherwise. Promotion
from fake data to real data is a separate governed decision, and not yours.

## spec.json

Create it at the repo root from the spec you agreed with the builder, in the shape
of `spec.json.example`. It is read by the tier classifier, by the human reviewer,
and by CI — which cross-checks the code against what the spec claims. Code that
contradicts its own spec fails the build.

`access.mode` is independent of the Green/Amber/Red tier. It is either `keycloak`
(central sign-in and per-app grants) or `public` (no sign-in). A public app lists each
anonymous page or collection operation in `access.anonymous`; it does not mean
all PocketBase collections are open. Public v1 supports static `GET /...` pages and
explicit collection operations such as `list:directory`; custom anonymous hook routes
are refused because the live audit cannot enumerate their handler checks. Do not
change the mode of an existing app through
the generic build: that needs an app-specific staged migration and tested rollback, and
the shared deploy refuses it. A legacy app already running behind Keycloak may be
classified with `access.transition.data`, `.tokens` and `.rollback`; production verifies
the existing OIDC state before recording that inventory.

## Delivery

Branch `draft/<slug>-1`, then a pull request into `main`. Never commit to `main`,
never merge, never approve. A human reviews it. That review is the point.

Assume the merge ships. Once a human approves and merges, this app goes live on its
own subdomain with no further step — the merge IS the deploy, and nobody gets a second
look between the two. Open the pull request in the state you would want
deployed, and say plainly in the description anything a reviewer should weigh, because
the description is the last place it can be said.
