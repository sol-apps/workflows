greenlight-lint — check a generated app against the spec it declares.

The generated surface is deliberately small: browser JavaScript plus PocketBase's
hook API, no npm, no Node process, no binaries. That makes the interesting failure
mode mechanically checkable rather than a matter of judgement — an app whose code
does more than its spec admits to is caught by grep, and never reaches a human
reviewer pretending to be something it isn't.

Run by .github/workflows/lint.yml on every pull request. Both this file and that
workflow live under .github/, which the same check forbids the generated app from
modifying.

# PocketBase SDK in it is what performs the OAuth2 code exchange. .claude/ is here for a different reason: it is
# an instruction channel aimed at whoever reviews this pull request. The build agent
# does not read it — its own skills come from Anthropic's Skills API, attached to the
# agent, never from the repository — but a human reviewing the PR with an agentic tool
# would, and the human review is the enforcement point of the entire platform. An app

# These three files are what make the app governed: the migration owns the role field
# and the rule that stops anyone setting their own role, the hook writes that role
# from the identity provider's claim on every login, and pb-auth.js is the only seam
# the app is supposed to reach identity through. An app that could edit them could
# decide its own permissions — and it would do so in a pull request whose diff a
# reviewer is reading for the app's FEATURES, which is exactly where it would pass.

# A flat "never touch these" made the review gate the thing that kept a five-day session
# token in place, and would equally have frozen every app's copy of this very file.
#
# So one edit is allowed and exactly one: make the file identical to the template's
# copy. Anything else — including a "small" tweak on top of a convergence — still
# fails. The comparison is against the template at main, fetched here rather than
# vendored, because a vendored copy is one more thing that can drift.
