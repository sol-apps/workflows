 * Identity schema for a reviewed app. Delivered by the template, protected by CI —
 * this file is not the generated app's to edit (see .github/lint.py).
 *
 * SCHEMA only. The OIDC provider's credentials are NOT here: they arrive at runtime
 * from the app's env and are applied on every boot by pb_hooks/identity.pb.js. A
 * migration is a one-shot, and configuration that can only ever be applied once is
 * configuration that silently misses the app provisioned before the IdP existed, and
 * cannot express a rotated client secret. Schema shape lives here; credentials live
 * in the env; neither is ever committed to this public repo.

  // Scoping it to the oauth2 context instead gives exactly the door we want: a record
  // can be created by completing an IdP login — which the IdP only permits to someone
  // who already holds a grant — and by nothing else. A plain POST to
  // /api/collections/users/records is still refused.

  // PocketBase's default for an auth collection is 432000s — FIVE DAYS (verified on a
  // fresh 0.39.5 instance, not inferred). That default silently undoes revocation:
  // the app's token is issued at login and is thereafter independent of both the
  // realm role and the IdP session, so removing someone's grant leaves their open tab
  // making authenticated calls, at whatever role their last login wrote, for the rest
  // of those five days. Revoke ends their ability to RE-ENTER; without this line it
  // does not end their access.
  //
  // Thirty minutes is the bound on that window. It is affordable only because
  // re-entry is cheap: pb-auth.js signs in through a popup against a live SSO cookie,
  // so a renewal is a round-trip to the IdP that costs a click and no page state —
  // and that round-trip is the point, because it is where the restriction is
  // re-evaluated. Renewing WITHOUT it is refused in pb_hooks/identity.pb.js.
