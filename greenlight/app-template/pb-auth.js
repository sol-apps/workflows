/* pb-auth.js — the single seam between this app and platform identity.
 *
 * People sign in once, at id.solhann.net, and the identity provider decides whether
 * they may enter THIS app at all: someone without a grant never reaches this file,
 * because they never get an authorization code. So the questions worth asking here
 * are "who is this" and "are they an admin of this app", not "are they allowed in".
 *
 * Do not reimplement any of this in app code, and do not read `role` from anywhere
 * but the record — it is set server-side from the identity provider's claim on every
 * login (pb_hooks/identity.pb.js) and cannot be set by the browser.
 *
 *   PBAuth.getClient()          PocketBase client, authenticated if signed in
 *   PBAuth.mode()               reviewed runtime access mode (promise)
 *   PBAuth.signIn()             start the OIDC login (returns a promise)
 *   PBAuth.signOut()            clear the local session
 *   PBAuth.user()               the signed-in record, or null
 *   PBAuth.isSignedIn()
 *   PBAuth.isAdmin()            true when this person is an admin OF THIS APP
 *   PBAuth.onChange(fn)         called whenever sign-in state changes
 *
 * Sessions are SHORT (thirty minutes) and there is no silent renewal: the server
 * refuses local token refresh on purpose, so the only way to get a new session is a
 * fresh sign-in at the identity provider — which is the one moment someone's grant is
 * re-checked. onChange fires with null the moment the session lapses; show a sign-in
 * control at that point and call signIn() from the click. Do not call signIn() on a
 * timer: a popup opened without a user gesture is blocked by the browser, and the
 * person is left looking at a page that silently stopped working.
 *
 * Collection rules key on `@request.auth.id`. An app whose rules key on anything the
 * browser can choose has no access control, only decoration.
